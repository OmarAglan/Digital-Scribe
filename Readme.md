## üèÅ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v18.x or higher)
*   npm or yarn
*   Git

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/digital-scribe.git
    cd digital-scribe
    ```

2.  **Install server dependencies:**
    ```sh
    cd server
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Install client dependencies:**
    ```sh
    cd ../client
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Set up environment variables:**
    *   Create a `.env` file in the `/server` directory.
    *   Add your database connection string and any other required keys (e.g., `MONGO_URI=your_connection_string`).

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the back-end server:**
    ```sh
    cd server
    npm run dev
    ```
    The server will start on `http://localhost:8080` and serve the translation API.

2.  **Start the front-end development server:**
    ```sh
    cd client
    npm run dev
    ```
    The React app will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Testing the API

You can test the translation endpoint directly:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/translate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "hello"}'
```

This will return an array of hieroglyph objects corresponding to the input text.
